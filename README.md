# Taste-Test-App

## What
 
If you're getting together to sample all the chicken sandwiches in town, check out this app. It's a simple project that I created to get familiar with RShiny. In other words, it's a fun pet project, but needs a lot of TLC.

That being said, this app is designed to assist your crew in determining either:

1. The best restaurant that serves a single item (what restaurant sells the best chicken sandwich), or
2. The best item at a restaurant (what item on the menu is everyone's fav).

You can find a current, though still patchy version of the app at [this link](https://garrettbduncan.shinyapps.io/tastetest_final/)
