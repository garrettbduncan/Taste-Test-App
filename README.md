# Taste-Test-App

## Why

One of my favorite family traditions is to do a blind taste test. We all decide what food item or restaurant to pick apart, rush out separately to run around town buying who knows what from who knows where, and let someone orchestrate the blind taste test. At first, our scoring was rudimentary, and I knew we could take things up a notch. This web app hopes to do that.

And I wanted to learn how to use RShiny :)

## What

This app is designed to assist your crew in determining either:

1. The best restaurant that serves a common item (what restaurant sells the best chicken sandwich), or
2. The best item at a restaurant (what item on the menu is everyone's fav).

Hopefully, you can have some fun with this app and learn a little more about food and each other. Part of the app looks at how people vote in relation to each other, something I thought would be interesting to look at.

All that said, this was my first RShiny app. In other words, it was a fun pet project and still needs a lot of TLC. If you try using the app and run into a bug, shoot me an email: garrettbduncan@gmail.com. For now, avoid spaces in your names for people or restaurants.

## Who

The app can incorporate up to 20 people and 11 restaurants and anywhere in between. Shoot me an invite if you're checking out 11 restaurants at once!

## Where

You can find a current, though still patchy version of the app at [this link](https://garrettbduncan.shinyapps.io/tastetest_final/)
